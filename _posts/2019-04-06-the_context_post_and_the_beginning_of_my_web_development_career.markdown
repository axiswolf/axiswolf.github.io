{TLDR; Running away from Oil and Gas and finding myself in code}

Hi everyone. I've been meaning to start this a while back but didn't really have the time to do it. I'm currently studying at USC right now for Petroleum Engineering and Engineering Management, so I have quite a bit on my plate. Initially, I got into the oil and gas industry because I studied atmospheric chemistry and noticed that the chemists who was bashing oil and gas have never stepped foot on the field.
I always seek knowledge and try my best to understand both sides, so after publishing two papers in Copenhagen, I went back to school. 

I am Asperger's and it has always been difficult for me to get the right accomodations with the disabilities services. I also did not like the structure of a classroom and preferred to learn by myself, at my own pace. 
Petroleum is also a monster of its own. There were no resources, no help, and all a guessing game. Something that is really hard for someone with my condition. What got me through the classes were the fact that some of the problems required us to code solutions. 

What got me to totally run away from Oil and Gas was the fact that I got what I wanted to experience in the end - by interning as a field engineer. No matter how much they claim the culture has changed, it is just the nature of the beast. 

After my internship, I asked to be placed in software engineering after graduation, but was meant with criticism. So now I'm paving my own way with Flatiron. 
So far, I've only met supportive people who help me learn instead of knocking me down. I'm excited to see where this takes me.

Wish me luck.
